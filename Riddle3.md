# The Mystery Begins 

## The Mystery Begins @showdialog

A cloud of smoke fills the dojo, and in the blink of an eye, Cody vanishes! Three mysterious figures leave behind a clue. Ninjas, it's up to you to find out what happened.

## Step 1: Set the Scene

Load the provided tilemap and check the on-game update container. Some sprites are appearing in the wrong order. Fix their sequence so everything looks right.

## Step 2: Add the Mystery Elements

The disappearance was randomâ€”but how? Fill in missing values for the `% chance` and `math random` blocks in the code to create a mysterious effect.

## Step 3: Restore Order

Sprites are out of place! Adjust the logic to ensure they appear correctly when the game updates.

## Step 4: Solve the Riddle
Make sure you meet the following requirements:
- Add enemies which result in a game over when players overlap
- Allow the players to throw projectiles on A button press
- Make smoke sprites appear at random intervals
- Make shurikens appear from the bottom of the screen with a _ chance
